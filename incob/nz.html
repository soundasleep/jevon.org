		<b>Nau Mai, Haere Mai - Welcome to New Zealand</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		The last major landmass to be
		discovered and occupied, New
		Zealand is an alluring mix of
		stunning landscapes, unique
		flora and fauna, and unspoiled
		countryside combined with
		pastoral scenes of surprising
		beauty. The overwhelming
		impression of the land is pure
		and green, with fresh air and
		clean waters.
	</p>
	<p>
		Nestled deep in the South
		Pacific, New Zealand offers a
		modern, sophisticated urban
		lifestyle combined with a natural,
		rural unspoiled heritage that sets
		it apart from the rest of the
		world. We have a stable political
		environment and have led the
		world in many areas of social
		policy, scientific achievements
		and sporting triumphs. For a
		nation of four million people,
		New Zealand produces an
		extraordinary large number of
		achievers in many areas.
	</p>
	<p>
		The country itself offers a superb
		environment of which New
		Zealanders take full advantage.
		Our clean, green countryside,
		unpolluted lakes, rivers and
		seas, combined with a
		temperate climate, provide a
		magnificent environment in
		which to live.
	</p>
	<p>
		From the majestic fjords and
		alps in the South Island to the
		native forests and silver sandy
		bays of the north, ours is a land
		of awesome beauty.
	</p>
	<p>
		Small cities are spaced the
		length of the country, with miles
		of green fields in between,
		populated by sheep and cows
		and interspersed with forests of
		native trees and bush or
		commercial forests of pine.
		Beautiful sub-tropical beaches
		are to be found everywhere -
		even within 10 minutes of
		downtown Auckland!
	</p>
	<p>
		New Zealanders are friendly,
		independent, free-spirited and
		welcoming. There is nothing we
		enjoy more than welcoming
		overseas visitors to our part of
		the South Pacific. Englishspeaking,
		the majority are of
		British heritage, with the culture
		of the native Maori people
		entwined into the strands of
		everyday life. New Zealand has
		also become home to people
		who have emigrated from a wide
		range of countries.
	</p>
	<p>
		We look forward
		to welcoming you
		to Aotearoa –
		the land of the
		long white cloud.
	</p>
	<p>
		No reira, Nau Mai
		Haere Mai ki
		Aotearoa.
	</p>
