<h1>Guidelines for Presenters</h1>

<div class="text">
	<h3>Participants</h3>

	<p>
	Except for the opening presentation by Professor Bruce Weir, there will be three parallel sessions throughout the conference.
	At each parallel session, there will be 40 minute presentations, usually by invited speakers at 9am, 11am, and 2pm.  The only
	exception to this will be for the DIMACS Symposium “Phylogenetics and Rapidly Evolving Pathogens” where most speakers will speak for 40 minutes.
	</p>

	<p>
	Even though talks are 40 minutes or 20 minutes long, the sessions are divided into 45 minute blocks.  Session Chairs have been requested to
	adhere closely to the 45 minute timeline for each block. We have done this to ensure that delegates who wish to attend a different session
	can do so without interrupting speakers.
	</p>

	<p>
	Participants can register for the tours of New Zealand with Sharron Hickman (<a href="mailto:SBHICKMAN@xtra.co.nz">SBHICKMAN@xtra.co.nz</a>)
	at the Registration Desk at the following times:
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Sunday 05 September</b> : 1800 to 2100 hours<br />
	<b>Monday 06 September</b> : 0730 to 0830 hours, 1230 to 1400 hours, 1530 to 1800 hours<br />
	<b>Tuesday 07 September</b> : 1230 to 1630 hours
	</p>

	<h3>Speakers</h3>

	<p>
	All speakers, except keynote speakers, will be allotted 20 minutes to speak.  Keynote speakers will be allotted 40 minutes.
	Speakers should allow some time (about 5 minutes) for questions.
	</p>

	<p>
	Speakers should have their presentations on CD, labelled with the speaker’s name, and the title, time, date and room of their presentation.
	CDs should be presented to the operators in the Speakers Preparation Room at least a day before the talk, and preferably upon registration.
	If speakers are not able to have their talks available on CD, they should use a USB memory stick.
	</p>

	<p>
	In each presentation room, there will be a Macintosh and PC computer available.  In addition, there will also be a document projector,
	in the event that overheads are used.
	</p>

	<p>
	If you are using Powerpoint, please email Allen Rodrigo (<a href="mailto:a.rodrigo@auckland.ac.nz">a.rodrigo@auckland.ac.nz</a>) to confirm
	whether it was created on a Macintosh or a PC, and also whether there is any supplementary content, e.g., MPEG, WAV or AVI files.
	If you are not using Powerpoint, please contact Allen to indicate how you will present your seminar.
	</p>

	<p>
	Please note that there may be members of the media present at your talk.
	</p>

	<h3>Poster Presenters</h3>

	<p>
	The poster session will be on Monday, 6 Sep 04, from 3:30pm onwards.  Posters may remain in the poster-viewing room until then
	end of the conference.  However, during the poster session, presenters are required to stand by their posters.
	</p>

	<p>
	Your poster should be no larger than 4' x 4' (1220 x 1220 mm). The poster boards for mounting have cork backing, and supplies
	(pins, tacks) will be available for mounting.
	</p>

	<h3>Session Chairs</h3>

	<p>
	All sessions are divided into 45 minute blocks, even though some talks are 40 minutes long and others are 20 minutes long.
	Session Chairs should encourage presenters to keep within their allotted time.  However, it is inevitable that there will be
	delays.  The 45 minute block is meant to take account of such delays, and allow sessions to be resynchronised every 45 minutes.
	It allows delegates to switch between parallel sessions, knowing that they can come in at the start of any 45 minute block.
	</p>

	<p>
	Session Chairs should keep to the 45 minute timeline.  Even if a speaker finishes early, please do not proceed until the 45
	minute timeline is reached.
	</p>

	<h3>Guidelines for Abstract Submission</h3>

	<p>
	Abstracts should be prepared for both oral and poster presentations.  Abstracts should be prepared using New Times Roman with a
	font size of 12 according to the format given in the example below. Abstracts must be no longer than half an A4 page.

		Bioinformatics Institute, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand<br />

		</p>

		<p>
		Bioinformatics is concerned with the computational organisation and analysis of biological <br />
		information.  In this talk, I describe the basic ideas of bioinformatics.  The aim is to keep <br />
		the presentation as simple as possible, while still conveying the key aspects of the  <br />
		discipline.  In other words, this presentation should be understood by people who have <br />
		little or no understanding of mathematics, statistics, computer science or biology.
