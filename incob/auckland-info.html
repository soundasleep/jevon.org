<h3>Auckland International Airport</h3>
<p>Agricultural Restrictions: New Zealand’s isolation has kept it free of many animal and plant diseases. To maintain
this position, restrictions are imposed on the importation of certain animal and plant materials. Before arrival you
will be asked to complete a declaration stating whether you have any foodstuffs, plant or animal material with
you or in your baggage. Before entering New Zealand, you will pass through an agriculture check. Officers may
check your baggage and some articles may need to be fumigated before they are returned to you.</p>
<p>For further information, visit <a href="http://www.maf.govt.nz" target="_blank">www.maf.govt.nz</a> or write to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, PO Box 2526
Wellington, New Zealand.</p>
<p>Customs Allowances: Visitors over 17 years are permitted to arrive with 200 cigarettes, 4.5 litres of wine or
beer; 1125 ml of spirits or liqueur. Goods costing more than NZ$700 may attract duty and tax.</p>
