[Visio](visio.md)

{% include gmf-css.md %}It is not too difficult to <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio-help/add-a-new-fill-pattern-line-pattern-or-line-ends-pattern-HP001231262.aspx">create a new line-end shape</a> in [Visio](visio.md). Firstly, you need to open up the _Drawing Explorer Window_:

<img src="/img/gmf/visio-1.png" class="gmf-left">

You can then browse into _Line Ends_ and create a new pattern:

<img src="/img/gmf/visio-2.png" class="gmf-left">

Make sure that the pattern is scaled, and select the type of line-end behaviour:

<img src="/img/gmf/visio-3.png" class="gmf-left">

Finally, you can create your pattern. This is where things get a little odd. I've found the best behaviour occurs when you make your pattern extremely small -- most of my patterns are about 4mm x 2mm. You might have some difficulty with line end orientation.

You can now use it as a line end in any normal Visio line dialog.
