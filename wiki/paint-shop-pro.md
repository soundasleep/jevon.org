[[Paint Shop Pro]] is a cheap, awesome graphic editor for [[Windows]] with its roots based in [[Web Development]].

==Creating Alpha PNG Images in Paint Shop Pro 7==
# Create an image
# Create a mask (this is the [[alpha]] layer)
# Save the mask to an alpha channel
# '''IMPORTANT:''' Delete the current mask, and don't merge it into the current layer. If you don't do this, the resulting image will be double-alphad.
# Save the image to a [[PNG]] file.
