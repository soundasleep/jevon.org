[[Unreal Engine 4]] is a game development engine that's shiny.

=="VR Preview" is greyed out==

If you don't currently have a VR device connected, and/or you haven't installed the Oculus/SteamVR SDKs, you can enable this option by enabling the "SimpleHMD" plugin (through Project Settings) and restarting.

This will allow you to view an emulated VR stereo view.
