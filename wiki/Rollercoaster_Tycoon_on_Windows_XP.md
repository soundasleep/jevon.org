## Problem
Trying to run Rollercoaster Tycoon in [Windows XP](windows-xp.md) results in the game crashing whenever you try to load a game.

## Solution
Install Microsoft Virtual PC, install [Windows 98](windows-98.md), install Rollercoaster Tycoon on that, play with that. It's not that bad, just a bit slow!
