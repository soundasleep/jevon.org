There are a number of open source and external projects used in the development of this site, which I will now credit here:

1. Uses social media icons derived from the <a href="http://www.paulrobertlloyd.com/2009/06/social_media_icons/">Social Media Icons project</a> (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">cc by-sa</a>).
