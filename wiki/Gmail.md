[Gmail](Gmail.md) is a web [email](email.md) client by [Google](google.md).

## Deleting mails from the Sent Mail folder

The _Sent Mail_ folder is not a folder or a label, but a magic system folder. To remove the "sent" label from the mail, you need to log into the Gmail server using [IMAP](imap.md) and move the mail from _[Gmail]/Sent Mail_ to _[Gmail]/All Mail_.
