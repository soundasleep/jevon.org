I shamelessly borrowed this recipe off Caroline. It's super tasty and good for winter, if stew meat is cheap!

Serves 3.

## Ingredients
* 500g beef stew/casserole steak
* 2 tsp oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2-3 cloves garlic, diced
* 1 can diced tomatoes
* 1 can thick tomato soup
* 1+ tsp of paprika
* misc vegetables, e.g.: carrot, capsicum
* (optional) 6-10 washed potatoes

## Instructions
1. Cook steak in a large pan with the oil.
1. Add the onion, garlic, carrots, capsicum etc.
1. Add the soup, tomatoes, paprika, salt and pepper to taste.
1. Simmer for 30-60 minutes (the longer you leave it simmering, the more tender it will become!).
1. Serve with optional boiled potatoes.
