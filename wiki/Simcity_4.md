[Simcity 4](Simcity_4.md) is a rather addictive city-building simulation game. Some of my articles on this game include:

1. [Creating Realistic Simcity 4 Terrains](Creating_Realistic_Simcity_4_Terrains.md)
1. [Simcity 4 Europa Terrain](Simcity_4_Europa_Terrain.md)
1. [Simcity 4 Music Track Names](Simcity_4_Music_Track_Names.md)

## Can't Install Simcity 4
If you can't install [Simcity 4](Simcity_4.md) - in particular, inserting the CD doesn't bring up any setup window, and you can't get the setup program to execute - the solution is really stupid. Just close any open windows with the title "Simcity 4" - even [explorer](explorer.md) windows.

You'd think they would have thought of a more sensible solution. :roll:
