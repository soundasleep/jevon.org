==Ingredients==

[code]
1-2 brown onions, diced finely
500 g mushrooms
6 C vegetable stock
2 tbsp crushed garlic
1.5 C arborio rice
3 tsp white wine
[/code]

==Instructions==

# Use a wide non-stick pan if possible
# Create vegetable stock by bringing water to boil; leave simmering
# Slice mushrooms up, fry until cooked, set aside
# In the same pan, fry up some oil + onion + crushed garlic on full heat, until the onion turns clear
# Add arborio rice, fry briefly
# Add wine, let it simmer briefly
# Turn pan heat down to ~half
# Slowly add simmering vegetable stock, half a cup at a time, stirring; let the rice simmer until the risotto has the texture and movement of "lava"
# Continue until almost all vegetable stock is added
# Finally, add mushrooms and remaining vegetable stock. Also add a bit more oil to improve the texture and taste
# Optionally add parmesan, salt or pepper

I also have great success using canned cherry tomatoes; use 0.5 C less vegetable stock, and use two cans of cherry tomatoes.
