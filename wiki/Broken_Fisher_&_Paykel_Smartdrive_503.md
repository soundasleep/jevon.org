Our F&P Smartdrive 503 washing machine wasn't working - it powered up OK, you could use the buttons, but it would not fill up with water.

After a bit of hunting and DIY diagnosis, I decided the lid switch (which is an inbuilt magnet) wasn't operating properly - apparently they are prone to wear and tear. The solution was to short out the lid switch, which is the two thin blue/black wires on the far right of the operation unit - I achieved this with just a stripped piece of random wire I found.

For some more information on this washing machine, you can also check out <a href="http://www.fp.co.nz/admin/pdfs/pdf_usecares/425983_aw_uc.pdf">the SmartDrive 503 user guide</a> and <a href="http://www.ukwhitegoods.co.uk/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=14362">a UK-based whiteware forum</a>, both of which were very useful in my analysis.
