[Winamp](winamp.md) is a cool free music player for [Windows](windows.md) available at www.winamp.com.

When using [Winamp](winamp.md), I tend to use this for a title format:
`[%artist% - ][%album% - ][%tracknumber% - ]$if2(%title%,$filepart(%filename%))`

## Slow Winamp Playlist Scroll
If scrolling through your Winamp playlist is going much slower than usual, you might have turned on "Highlight the background of missing playlist entries" in General > Jump to File > Missing Files.
