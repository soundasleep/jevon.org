[Winamp](Winamp.md) is a cool free music player for [Windows](Windows.md) available at www.winamp.com.

Articles about Winamp:
1. [Making MSN 7 use Winamp for Now Playing](Making_MSN_7_use_Winamp_for_Now_Playing.md)

When using [Winamp](Winamp.md), I tend to use this for a title format:
`[%artist% - ][%album% - ][%tracknumber% - ]$if2(%title%,$filepart(%filename%))`

## Slow Winamp Playlist Scroll
If scrolling through your Winamp playlist is going much slower than usual, you might have turned on "Highlight the background of missing playlist entries" in General > Jump to File > Missing Files.
