==Importing an old Thunderbird profile==
It's easy to import an old Thunderbird profile into a fresh new install.

# Install Thunderbird and let it create a new profile.
# Copy and paste the old profile data (Mail folders, etc) into the new profile.
# Start the fresh install of Thunderbird.

Thunderbird will automatically load the old profile information (including saved passwords and mail filters, along with all old e-mails).
