[[Gmail]] is a web [[email]] client by [[Google]].

==Deleting mails from the Sent Mail folder==

The _Sent Mail_ folder is not a folder or a label, but a magic system folder. To remove the "sent" label from the mail, you need to log into the Gmail server using [[IMAP]] and move the mail from _[Gmail]/Sent Mail_ to _[Gmail]/All Mail_.
