, Palmerston North (Roughly at http://tinyurl.com/cjzaq :P)
Time: Setup begins at 11am, LAN begins at noon

You need to bring at the very least:
* Your computer
* A network cable
* Power cables
* A multibox for you to plug your power cables in
* Headphones
* A gold coin donation to go towards power usage over the weekend :P

Please bring, if it is possible:
* An extra network cable for people who are retards
* Power extension cables - we will have to use power from other rooms!
* Possibly furniture to set up your stuff on - we only have a few proper LANable tables and chairs.
* Food etc. We will probably be having pizza for dinner @ 6pm from Dominoes since it is just across the road.
