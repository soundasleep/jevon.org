[Facebook](facebook.md) is a social networking site which is dumb.

## Downloading one of your Facebook Photo albums
Using the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dyi">Download Your Information</a> functionality, you can download a [ZIP](zip.md) file of your personal information and photos. However, photos will not be included in the ZIP itself, rather they will be inline images. Therefore you can:

1. Browse to the particular album
1. (In Firefox) Right click the page
1. Select "View Page Info" > "Media"
1. Select all of the download images, click "Save As..." and select a folder to save these images to
1. You now have all of the album photos in a single folder
