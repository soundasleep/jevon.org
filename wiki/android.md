[code]Downloading Documentation for Android SDK, API 17, revision 1
URL not found: C:/Program Files (x86)/Android/android-sdk/temp/docs-17_r01.zip (Access is denied)[/code]

This error can occur within the Android SDK Manager on Windows 7, if the SDK manager is installed <a href="http://www.coderanch.com/t/526550/Android/Mobile/Install-Android-platforms-Android-SDK">to a protected folder</a> like `C:/Program Files (x86)`. In my case, the solution was to run the SDK manager as an Administrator.
