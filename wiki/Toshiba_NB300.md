The [Toshiba NB300](Toshiba_NB300.md) is a netbook that I just bought.

## Things I Like
1. I could upgrade [Windows](Windows.md) versions without having to connect or load any media - using the Windows Anytime Upgrade service.

## Things I Don't Like
1. The software that comes with the netbook is just ridiculous. Symantec Antivirus? I don't think so!
1. There's no external button to switch the wireless on/off.

## Black Loading Screen
When booting, there is no animated [Windows 7](windows-7.md) loading screen. Apparently this is because the animated loading screen has a minimum resolution of 1024x768, but the minimum resolution of the netbook is 1024x700 - causing the corruption.
