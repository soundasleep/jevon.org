[[Facebook]] is a social networking site which is dumb.

==Downloading one of your Facebook Photo albums==
Using the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dyi">Download Your Information</a> functionality, you can download a [[ZIP]] file of your personal information and photos. However, photos will not be included in the ZIP itself, rather they will be inline images. Therefore you can:

# Browse to the particular album
# (In Firefox) Right click the page
# Select "View Page Info" > "Media"
# Select all of the download images, click "Save As..." and select a folder to save these images to
# You now have all of the album photos in a single folder
