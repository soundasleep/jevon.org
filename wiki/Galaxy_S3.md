## Facebook upload stuck in notifications

This is <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1725570">probably a problem with the Facebook application</a>. In my case <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=27742800&postcount=5">the answer</a> was to go Settings > Application Manager > Facebook > Clear data. I did have to relogin to Facebook though.
