Ever since I was seven years old, I've been playing around with computers. As I am now taking a degree in Software Engineering at Massey University, computers are now a permanent part of my life. At the moment I have two computers:

**Computer 1** is a custom-built computer, which I put together myself. It features:
* Athlon XP 1800+ (1.53GHz) CPU
* Epox 8K3A VIA KT333 Motherboard
* Thermaltake Volcano 7+ for CPU Cooling
* Samsung 256MB DDR333 PC2700 Memory
* Leadtek Winfast Geforce3 Ti200 128MB DDR Video Card
* Maxtor 7200rpm ATA/133 60GB Hard Drive
* Seagate 7200rpm ATA/100 80GB Hard Drive new!
* 40x/12x/48x AOpen CD-RW Drive
* 6x/32x BTC DVD Drive
* Generic 17" CRT Monitor

**Computer 2** used to be a PC Company retail computer, purchased two years ago, which has now become redundant (when I upgraded to the nice little box above!) and is now a personal file server/web server. It features:
* Celeron 433MHz @ 481MHz CPU
* Epox 3VBM Motherboard
* Generic 320MB PC100/PC133 SDRAM Memory
* Generic TNT2 M64 32MB Video Card
* Maxtor 5400rpm 10GB Hard Drive
* Dynalink ADSL modem

In the software-based side of things, I like to do [software development](Software.md) and [web scripting](Web_Development.md), and also tinkering with the computers themselves. I enjoy software development in [Visual Basic](Visual_Basic.md) and C/C++; but low-level [Assembly](assembly.md) and even digital logic and machine code interests me. I prefer web scripting in [PHP](PHP.md) and [ASP](asp.md). I prefer [MySQL](MySQL.md) for database access in [PHP](PHP.md).
