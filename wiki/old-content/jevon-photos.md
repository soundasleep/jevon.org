Here are a few pictures of me. As we speak, I have a [tip=only one of the flashest digital cameras I have ever seen - takes up to 5 megapixels!]digital camera[/tip] on hand, and I'm taking photos over this weekend. These are some of the (better) photos I have taken recently. I should be able to take some more over the weekend and stick those online too.
