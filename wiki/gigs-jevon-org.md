The '''Gigs.jevon.org''' website was a site that automatically retrieved event listings from local <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a> bands, integrated them with <a href="http://www.last.fm">last.fm data</a>, and sent out weekly e-mails about upcoming events in your area.

However, I've now stopped this site, for two main reasons:

# Legal reasons; the data on MySpace is probably not copyable, even if MySpace didn't create the data to begin with. :roll:
# The last.fm site now has an <a href="http://www.last.fm/events/">events system</a> which is really neat. It does everything that the Gigs site intended to do.

So there's no point in putting extra content into the Internet ;)
