[Microsoft](microsoft.md) [Powerpoint](powerpoint.md) is a software for designing and presenting presentations.

## Autofit not working after save
If a text box has been set to auto-fit, and you save the document, and re-open it and the auto-fit has been lost, this has been <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827759/en-us">confirmed as a bug in Powerpoint 2002/2003</a>.

One solution is to make sure there is <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827759/en-us">only one slide master</a>.

Another is to <a href="http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00849.htm">move the text into a separate text box</a>, unrelated to the slide master.
