<img src="/img/nokia 2730.png" align="right">I just bought a Nokia 2730 [Mobile Phone](mobile-phone.md). Here are some various notes.

## Things I Enjoy about my Nokia 2730
(Compared to my last two phones: A [Samsung ZV10](samsung-zv10.md) and a [Nokia 2125](nokia-2125.md))

* It works with [Google Sync](google-sync.md)!
* Google Sync!!
* It shows images of your contacts (from Google Sync) when a phone or message comes through.
* It has an e-mail client that interacts with any e-mail provider, including Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, or a custom [POP](pop.md) or [IMAP](imap.md)
* To do a smiley of :) or :(, you can type '..'
* To select a symbol, you just have to press '*' once
* Applications can be downloaded and moved anywhere
* Applications can be loaded onto the memory card outside of the phone
* It directly supports firmware updates (although none have been released yet)
* Downloading and uploading files have been unified across all interfaces
* When moving files, you can create a new folder in the same window
* It supports limited multitasking (I think two applications can run at the same time?)
* It has an inbuilt radio that finds stations automatically, and the radio can be put on loudspeaker
* It has a 1600x1200 camera (though the <a href="http://share.ovi.com/media/jevonwright.PublicAlbum/jevonwright.10002">picture quality is fairly average</a>)
* Photos can be taken in portrait or landscape mode
* It can directly upload to the web, or (<a href="http://thesymbianblog.com/2008/02/22/if-flickrovi-doesnt-show-up-in-share-online-3/">through some configuration</a>) through [Flickr](flickr.md)
* Images can be selected and saved directly from a web page
* Contact details can be selected and saved from a web page
* When writing a text message, contact details can be selectively inserted _without_ the message becoming a multimedia one (stupid Samsung phone!)
* You can save MMS message content directly as text files and/or images
* It has a counter for the bandwidth you've used, the airtime you've used, even the number of messages (and number of parts) that you've used
* It supports [Opera Mini](opera-mini.md), which is awesome
* When composing a message, you can just enter in the first few characters of the recipient's name, and you will search 
* You can add multiple recipients to a message by "marking" them individually
* When adding many contacts to a message with multiple details, you will be prompted to select the desired detail for each
* When a text message has an e-mail address added, it will become a multimedia message; but as soon as the e-mail address is removed, it reverts back to a text message <3
* ...

## Things I Don't Enjoy
* You cannot add additional main menu icons (I think)
* <strike>Navigation shortcut keys can't be set to downloaded applications</strike> Navigation keys _can_ be set to downloaded applications; just go through _Applications List_

## Google Sync
Yes, you can use this phone with <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/sync/">Google Sync</a>. Follow the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=98011">instructions provided by Google</a>.

Sadly [Google](google.md) only supports contact synchronisation with SyncML, so they cannot synchronise a calendar (etc). But considering the size of my [Google Calendar](google-calendar.md), that's probably a good thing ;)
