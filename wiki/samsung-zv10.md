## Problems with PC Studio 3
I couldn't connect to this phone using _PC Studio 3_ via [Bluetooth](bluetooth.md). First I couldn't automatically connect via the Bluetooth wizard; in the end, I had to set up a [dial-up networking](dial-up-networking.md) connection manually over Bluetooth, which was using port COM40. I then couldn't get pass this error:

_Phone is in use. Please go to the main screen and try to connect again._

In the end I couldn't solve this problem at all, and had to spend quite some time to try find the [USB](usb.md) cable...
