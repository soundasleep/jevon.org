An older-style [[mobile phone]] by [[Samsung]].

==Problems with PC Studio 3==
I couldn't connect to this phone using ''PC Studio 3'' via [[Bluetooth]]. First I couldn't automatically connect via the Bluetooth wizard; in the end, I had to set up a [[dial-up networking]] connection manually over Bluetooth, which was using port COM40. I then couldn't get pass this error:

''Phone is in use. Please go to the main screen and try to connect again.''

In the end I couldn't solve this problem at all, and had to spend quite some time to try find the [[USB]] cable...

==Interesting Codes==
'''* # 06 #''' : IMEI number
'''* # 1234 #''': Software/firmware version
'''* # 7465625 #''': = Check the locks (more information: http://tinyurl.com/dyma5)
