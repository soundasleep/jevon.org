[[WinKey]] was an old piece of software distributed by <a href="http://www.copernic.com">Copernic</a>, which allowed you to map WinKey+key shortcuts to run programs, open windows, and lots of other things.

For reasons which I can't understand, you cannot download WinKey anymore, and it doesn't seem to appear in any of their other products. So, here's a backup copy of the WinKey installer. Enjoy!
