[[Winamp]] is a cool free music player for [[Windows]] available at www.winamp.com.

When using [[Winamp]], I tend to use this for a title format:
[code][%artist% - ][%album% - ][%tracknumber% - ]$if2(%title%,$filepart(%filename%))[/code]

==Slow Winamp Playlist Scroll==
If scrolling through your Winamp playlist is going much slower than usual, you might have turned on "Highlight the background of missing playlist entries" in General > Jump to File > Missing Files.
