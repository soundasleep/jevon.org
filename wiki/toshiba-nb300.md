The [[Toshiba NB300]] is a netbook that I just bought.

==Things I Like==
# I could upgrade [[Windows]] versions without having to connect or load any media - using the Windows Anytime Upgrade service.

==Things I Don't Like==
# The software that comes with the netbook is just ridiculous. Symantec Antivirus? I don't think so!
# There's no external button to switch the wireless on/off.

==Black Loading Screen==
When booting, there is no animated [[Windows 7]] loading screen. Apparently this is because the animated loading screen has a minimum resolution of 1024x768, but the minimum resolution of the netbook is 1024x700 - causing the corruption.
