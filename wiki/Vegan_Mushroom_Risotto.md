## Ingredients

```
1-2 brown onions, diced finely
500 g mushrooms
6 C vegetable stock
2-3 Tbsp crushed garlic
1.5 C arborio rice
3 tsp white wine
```

## Instructions

1. Use a wide non-stick pan if possible
1. Create vegetable stock by bringing water to boil; leave simmering
1. Slice mushrooms up, fry until cooked, set aside
1. In the same pan, fry up some oil + onion + crushed garlic on full heat, until the onion turns clear
1. Add arborio rice, fry briefly
1. Add wine, let it simmer briefly
1. Turn pan heat down to ~half
1. Slowly add simmering vegetable stock, half a cup at a time, stirring; let the rice simmer until the risotto has the texture and movement of "lava"
1. Continue until almost all vegetable stock is added
1. Finally, add mushrooms and remaining vegetable stock. Also add a bit more oil to improve the texture and taste
1. Optionally add parmesan, salt or pepper

I also have great success using canned cherry tomatoes; use 0.5 C less vegetable stock, and use two cans of cherry tomatoes.
