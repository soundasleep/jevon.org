[My Software](Software.md)

## Description
Your IP, quite simply, displays your current [IP](ip.md) address, as well as letting to press a button to copy it to the clipboard. Most useful for finding out your current IP address.

This is an update on my other Your IP program. It insteads sends an Internet request, and once this connection succeeds, reads the correct IP address (and then closes the socket). This lets the "correct" Internet IP address be displayed in Windows 2000/XP.

This is still pretty lame and can't get around the [LAN](lan.md) IP, and a better way to obtain your IP is to use a site like http://www.showmyip.com.
