[My Software](Software.md)

## Description
This very simple program was designed for one thing in mind - to help you calculate the BPM of anything. Just tap along on your keyboard along to the song and it will calculate the BPM for you.

I found that some programs wanted to charge more than US $30 for doing that. What the hell? Lol

You will require the [Visual Basic 6.0 Runtimes](Visual_Basic_Runtimes.md) and the mscomctl.ocx control, if you don't already have them (Windows 9x).
