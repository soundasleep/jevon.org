==Description==
"Font Selector" is a simple program that lists all the fonts available on your system, and lets you select any font. It shows a font preview, and lets you select a number of modifications. It's meant for HTML work, allowing you to select a font, a size, and any number of bold/italic/underline attributes.

When you click the "Copy Tag" button, the required HTML font tag will be copied to your clipboard, allowing you to paste it anywhere in any HTML editor.
