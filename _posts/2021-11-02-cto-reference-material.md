I am not yet a CTO of a medium or large business, but here is a collection of books, resources and thoughts I think will be relevant to any new CTO.

*This is a work in progress. Feel free to contribute.*

# Management

## An Elegant Puzzle - Will Larson

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1732265186/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1732265186&linkCode=as2&tag=jevonorg-20&linkId=50bb30cb9df93b73364d5041782dcc13"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=1732265186&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=jevonorg-20" ></a>

By far my favourite book of all time. An absolute treasure chest of effective engineering management strategies, from managing individuals, to managing teams, to forming teams, to recruiting, to time management. Includes strategies for what to do when you're sinking or barely staying afloat (pay off debt and let your investments snowball).

Strongly strongly recommended. I love this book so much.

# Delegation

### Turn the Ship Around! - L. David Marquet

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591846404/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591846404&linkCode=as2&tag=jevonorg-20&linkId=44711980073269d2ff093011ea00ce9c"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=1591846404&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=jevonorg-20" ></a>

I'm only half-way through but this is a great book about how to delegate, and how it often starts from the smallest change, enabling people to do their best work - and trusting them to do it.

It assumes that you have the power/authority/structure _to_ delegate, however.

# Being effective

### Measure What Matters - John Doerr

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078FZ9SYB/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B078FZ9SYB&linkCode=as2&tag=jevonorg-20&linkId=1b9b3349e5f161840c17cfc06982203b"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B078FZ9SYB&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=jevonorg-20" ></a>

The source of truth guide on OKRs (Objectives and Key Results).

Good OKRs are not 100% trickle down, they are social contracts that your teams publish.

# Burnout

### Beyond Burnout - Suzi McAlpine

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QBGW4D3/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08QBGW4D3&linkCode=as2&tag=jevonorg-20&linkId=afe319327e915bccafd62d26c13395c7"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B08QBGW4D3&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=jevonorg-20" ></a>

_Beyond Burnout_ is definitely the best book I've read on the topic. 
It covers how to identify burnout, how to stop it, and how to prevent it, from three different perspectives: 

1. As an individual who may have burnout,
2. As a manager of others who may have burnout, and
3. As a leader of an organisation.

Generally it is not the _quantity_ of work that impacts burnout, but the _quality_. Humans need validation and acceptance and to feel fairly rewarded. Trying to do too much with too little is a recipe for burnout.

Amazingly this book was released in mid-2021 from a New Zealand perspective. It's suitable for software professionals, execs, and medical staff.
