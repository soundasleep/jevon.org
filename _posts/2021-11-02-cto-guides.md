I am not yet a CTO of a medium or large business, but here is a collection of books, resources and thoughts I think will be relevant to any new CTO.

# Burnout

_Beyond Burnout_ is definitely the best book I've read on the topic. 
It covers how to identify burnout, how to stop it, and how to prevent it, from three different perspectives: 

1. As an individual who may have burnout,
2. As a manager of others who may have burnout, and
3. As a leader of an organisation.

Generally it is not the _quantity_ of work that impacts burnout, but the _quality_. Humans need validation and acceptance and to feel fairly rewarded. Trying to do too much with too little is a recipe for burnout.
