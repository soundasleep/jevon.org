Tēnā koutou e hoa mā!

I'm a software architect, [game designer](https://stormcloak.games), enterpreneur, musician, [researcher](/wiki/Research.md), and community leader based in beautiful [Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Aotearoa](https://wellingtonnz.com).

Welcome to my little slice of the Internet.

**[I'm making a game! 🙀🎉](https://stormcloak.games/2021/11/17/going-fulltime)**
  
The game is called _[Adaptory](https://adaptorygame.com)_, and is a base-building survival game, combining multiple complex simulations with a story-rich world.

I'll be posting updates of my progress on the [website](https://adaptorygame.com), the [dev blog](https://stormcloak.games/blog), or on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/jevon).
