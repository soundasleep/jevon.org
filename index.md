Kia ora!

I'm [Jevon Wright](/wiki/Jevon_Wright.md), a software engineer and community volunteer based in [Wellington, New Zealand](https://wellingtonnz.com). This is my home page! ;)

I'm passionate about software engineering, community work, open source, gender studies, cryptocurrencies,
gaming and [music](https://last.fm/user/jdub_dub).
I have a [PhD in Computer Science](/wiki/Research.md) and am currently
the founder of [CryptFolio](https://cryptfolio.com),
Treasurer of [OuterSpaces Charitable Trust](https://www.outerspaces.org.nz), and
Front-end Lead at [Flux Federation](https://fluxfederation.com).

Some of my [open source projects](https://github.com/soundasleep) include
[html2text](https://github.com/soundasleep/html2text),
[html2text_ruby](https://github.com/soundasleep/html2text_ruby),
[openclerk](https://github.com/soundasleep/openclerk) and
[statgit2](https://github.com/soundasleep/statgit2).

Contact me at [support@jevon.org](mailto:support@jevon.org) and use my [public key](/wiki/Public_Key.md).

I am not currently looking for additional employment, but please consider [donating](http://www.outerspaces.org.nz/donate) to the groups I'm involved with.
