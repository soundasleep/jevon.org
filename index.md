Tēnā koutou e hoa mā!

I'm a software architect, enterpreneur, musician, [researcher](/wiki/Research.md), and community leader based in beautiful [Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Aotearoa](https://wellingtonnz.com).

Welcome to my little slice of the Internet.

I'll be posting updates of my progress on the [blog](https://stormcloak.games/blog) or on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/jevon).
